  <longdescription>
    openscad-language-server is an LSP (Language Server Protocol) server for
    OpenSCAD. It enables IDE-style features for OpenSCAD code in any editor for
    which an LSP client is available—i.e., most major modern text editors.
    Status: Pretty basic by IDE standards, but functional and well beyond what
    the built-in OpenSCAD editor provides. Tested primarily with lsp-mode on
    Emacs on Linux.
